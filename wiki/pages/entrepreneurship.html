    <h2>Patents and intellectual property</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your wiki and at the Jamboree, so any work you don't present can't count towards your project.</p>
    <p>This is an area where we are different as we care about sharing, openness and contributing to the community and investors don't always agree with these values. It is up to you and your team to decide what to do. Remember that most universities have a commercialization department and that you can talk to them before coming to a decision.</p>

<h2 id='title2'><strong>Brief Introduction of Business Plan</strong></h2>
<h3 id='produts--services'><strong>Produts &amp; Services</strong></h3>
<p>In the first part, CPU_CHINA analyzes the necessity to screen for early-stage cancer and the value it will bring to society. We list the current methods of cancer diagnosis, which are not fully applicable to underdeveloped areas with poor medical conditions. And this is the reason why we design Cancer Stalker. </p>
<h3 id='the-market'><strong>The Market</strong></h3>
<p>In the second part, CPU_CHINA analyzes the synthetic biology market and that of early cancer screening, both of which are massive and promising. So it’s obvious that under this circumstance, Cancer Stalker has great potential to be commercialized.</p>
<h3 id='competitive-analysis'><strong>Competitive Analysis</strong></h3>
<p>Coming to the third part, CPU_CHINA investigates the macro environment for Cancer Stalker development using PEST, analyzes the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of Cancer Stalker using the SWOT method comprehensively, and proposes solutions.</p>
<h3 id='marketing-plan'><strong>Marketing Plan</strong></h3>
<p>And for the fourth part, we divided our target users into two groups:<br/>1.Rural health care centers and village clinics in underdeveloped areas with poor medical conditions in China; 
2.The general public who are more aware of early cancer screening, such as people with a family history of cancer, researchers who are engaged in the medical and biological field, and collars who work under pressure and don&#39;t have time to go to hospitals for early cancer screening. 
CPU_CHINA conceptualized the business plan for each group and settled down to two business models as well as different marketing strategies in different stages.</p>
<h3 id='risk-management'><strong>Risk Management</strong></h3>
<p>In the last part, when determining the feasibility of a project, it&#39;s crucial to evaluate its risks. CPU_CHINA analyzes 5 risks of our project and proposes corresponding countermeasures as well.</p>
<p>Here is our business plan：</p>
