            <p>CPU_CHINA prepared the template of LINC00857. It was selected as cancer biomarker by our team. We synthesized the DNA template through the company, and obtained RNA by in vitro transcription as shown in <b>Figure1</b>. Then we measured RNA concentration by UV spectrophotometry, and got the RNA’s concentration of 4792.608ng/μL, as shown in <b>Figure 2</b>.

            <p>The RT-RPA process lasted for 30min and the results of which was verified by electrophoresis. As shown in <b>Figure 4</b>. The electrophoretic pattern of RT-RPA showed that after 30 minutes of amplification, nucleic acids were massively amplified. However, different concentrations of template did not show significant differences in the amount of amplification products. That&#39;s probably because the amplification time was too long to allow each concentration group to enter a plateau. Therefore, we changed the amplification duration in the later experiment.

            <h2 id='title2'>Cas protein cleavage activity</h2>
            <p>In the initial design, since CasΦ has small size, strong specificity and low dependence on PAM sequence, we hoped to use CasΦ to connect RT-RPA and DNA nanosponge system to enhance the specificity of our entire system. However, the cleavage activity of CasΦ is lower than that of Cas12a and Cas14a. Therefore, we hope to improve CasΦ&#39;s cutting rate and specificity, and establish a better CRISPR-Cas system for detection.
            <p>We then conducted directed revolution for CasΦ protein, and screened for protein mutants with faster cutting rate and sgRNA with lower off-target rate through rational design. By points mutation of the key amino acids in the charge center in helix α7, mutant CasΦ nucleases were obtained. The positive controls Mut-1 (nCasΦ) and Mut-2 (vCasΦ) were designed by Doudna's team. Our team designed the mutants Mut-3 through Mut-6. The detailed mutation content is shown in Table 1. On the other hand, as reported by Gersbach et al, a hairpin secondary structure onto the spacer region of crRNA can increase the CRISPR-Cas system specificity for target cleavage. To verify whether this strategy is effective for the trans-cleavage activity of CasΦ, we introduced different lengths of hairpin structures into the crRNA of CasΦ (<b>Table 2.</b>). <b>Figure 5</b> shows that we successfully expressed and purified the CasΦ protein.</p>

            <p>We first performed the FQ reporter cleavage assay with wild-type CasΦ, Cas12a and Cas14a to verify the dsDNA target triggered trans-cleavage activity. The results showed that Cas12a had the best activity, followed by Cas14a and CasΦ.

            <p>Then, we expressed and purified the Mut-1 (nCasΦ) and Mut-2 (vCasΦ), which were designed by Doudna&#39;s lab, and the results were in line with what was previously published. And the four mutant proteins (Mut-3 to Mut-6) were constructed by our team. The target triggered trans-cleavage activity of wild-type and mutant Cas was assessed using the fluorophore quencher (FQ) reporter assays. As shown in <b>Figure 9</b>, in Mut-3 to Mut-6, only Mut-4 (Neg-K) had showed the ssDNA target triggered trans-cleavage activity. Compared to the wild-type, Mut-4 (Neg-K) exhibits a high ssDNA target triggered trans-cleavage activity, which has comparable cleavage activity to the Mut-1 designed by Doudna's group. These results further verify the hypothesis that the helix α7 might regulate the accessibility of the RuvC domain for association of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA).</p>

            <p>We incorporated various lengths of hairpin structures into the crRNA of Cas to test the viability of this method for the trans-cleavage activity. As shown in <b>Figure 10</b>, the specificity of the Cas system for target recognition may be improved by crRNA with a 4-base pair stem structure (H4), according to our comparison of the specific signal from the complementary target and the non-specific signal from MT13.<br/> <html>

            <p>Finally, we blended various numbers of ssDNA target sequences with mismatch sequences (MT13) to prepare artificial samples containing 50% to 0% DNA mutations, in order to test the performance of our optimized CRISPR-Cas system for detecting DNA mutations from a vast number of background sequences. Mut-4 (Neg-K) and crRNA H4 were the two options we used to build the mutation detection system. As seen in <b>Figure 11</b>, the Mut-4 (Neg-K)/H4 system performed better at detecting mutations than the traditional wild-type/hairpin-free crRNA system (WT/CrRNA in <b>Figure 11</b>).

            <p>After the modification of CasΦ system, we further compared the the dsDNA target triggered trans-cleavage activity of Cas12a, Cas14a, and Neg-K/H4 systems. Unfortunately, despite the significant improvement in ssDNA target triggered trans-cleavage activity and specificity of the Neg-K/H4 system compared to the WT/CrRNA system, the dsDNA target triggered activity of the Neg-K/H4 system is still poor compared to the more mature Cas12a and Cas14a systems (<b>Figure 12</b>). This may be due to the long dsDNA targets are difficult to dissociate from the CasΦ proteins, resulting in weak activity. Therefore, in order to use the best Cas system in our system, we narrowed down the candidates to Cas12a and Cas14a.

As a result, Cas14a is capable to complete the precise quantification of our system.

            <p>We further validated the ability of Cas12a and Cas14a to cleave DNA nanosponge in our system. We found that the ability of Cas12a and Cas14a to cleavage DNA nanosponge and release γ-amylase was similar, which was inconsistent with the relative activity of the two in the previous FQ reporter assay. This may be because the Cas system can only effectively release the enzyme in the shallow layer of DNA nanosponge, while it is difficult to release the enzyme in the deep layer. Therefore, the difference between the two is reduced in the cleavage of nucleic acid nanostructures. Since it has been reported in the literature that Cas14a has stronger specificity for the target sequence and can identify single-base mismatches in the target, which is more in line with the requirements of our system for specific target recognition. Therefore, we decided to choose Cas14a in the final project design.
            <h2 id='title3'>MBD-SA</h2>
            <p>To construct the DNA Nanosponge, we creatively fused MBD and SA into MBD-SA fusion protein. MBD-SA will bind to the stem-loop structure formed by the CGAT CCGCGGC TCTCTC GCCGCGG ATCG fragment in the RCA product sequence. MBD-SA integrates the advantages of both proteins to enable the fusion protein to bind non-modified DNA multivalently.
            <p>The MBD-SA fusion protein was identified by Western blot to prove that we had successfully constructed MBD-SA fusion protein with streptavidin activity. As shown in <b>Figure 14</b>, MBD-BCCP as a control group could not show a band when interacting with HRP-biotin. MBD-SA can show a band on ECL by interacting with HRP-biotin.

On the other hand, MBD-SA also shows a high affinity for unmethylated DNA, which allows us to directly use RCA products for DNA nanosponge assembly.

            <h2 id='title4'>DNA Nanosponge</h2>
            <p>In order to construct a three-dimensional network formed by DNA to encapsulateγ-amylase which enables actived Cas14a to cleavage, we designed a DNA nanosponge. The DNA nanosponge is constructed by RCA (Rolling Circle Amplification) products and MBD-SA fusion protein. The MBD-SA fusion protein with 4 MBD structural domains can recognize and bind the repetitive CpG sites in the stem-loop structure in RCA-amplicons. In this way, the RCA-amplicons with stem-loop structure and MBD-SA fusion protein can self-assembled into a three-dimensional network called DNA nanosponge by us, then we use it to encapsulateγ-amylase (<b>Figure 19</b>).

            <p>In order to find out the best conditions for preparing DNA nanosponge, we used cyclized DNA with different length as raw materials to synthesize different groups of DNA nanosponge. Then we temporarily used Deoxyribonuclease I to play the role of DNA cleavage, and observed the release of amylase from different groups of DNA nanosponge after degradation. We found that DNA with 60nt of probe formed the best DNA nanosponge (<b>Figure 21</b>).

            <p>To find out how long it takes from DNA nanosponge degradation to glucose release, we measured the amount of glucose released at different time points.

            <h2 id='title5'>Integration</h2>
            <p>In the end, we combined all parts of the system for testing, including RT-RPA, Cas14a enzyme digestion and release of DNA nano sponge γ-amylase, and determine the glucose concentration produced after the amylase enters the starch containing system.</p>
            <p>We created a target RNA concentration gradient from 10<sup>1</sup> to 10<sup>4</sup>, which covers the concentration that may occur in the real-world samples, in order to verify that our system can effectively discriminate targets with varied concentrations and complete quantification in real samples. In the beginning, we examined the experimental setup of RT-RPA amplicons after 10 min, and 200 nM Cas14a. The results revealed that group 10<sup>4</sup> differed from the other groups in a substantial way, demonstrating the capability of our integrated system to assess the concentration difference. The final glucose content of the other three groups, however, was nearly identical. We thought this was caused by either the high concentration of Cas14a, or the high efficiency of RT-RPA, which caused the amplification to reach a plateau. Since it cannot precisely gauge our goal's concentration, this is obviously at odds with our objective. As a result, we chose to cut the RT-RPA period in half to 5 minutes and lower the Cas14a concentration to 100 nM. The results indicate that our system can quantify the target  (<b>Figure 26</b>). Because the concentration of the target we input is favorably connected with the final glucose signal when the settings are changed. This has accomplished our primary objective of creating a practical, extremely precise, and sensitive detecting system. </p>
