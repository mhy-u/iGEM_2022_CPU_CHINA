            <h2 id='title1'>Overview</h2>
            <p>We&#39;re glad you&#39;re here. On this page, we&#39;ll introduce our engineering concept based on synthetic biology, as well as the advancements in research and project design. We also discuss the techniques we employed to evaluate the objectivity and viability of our project. We will focus on the conceptual development and engineering cycle of the entire project, and present the progress of our engineering in an order of ”Brief Introduction” &quot;Design&quot;, &quot;Build&quot;, &quot;Test&quot; and &quot;Result&quot; .</p>
            <h2 id='title2'>Cas protein </h2>
            <h3 id='brief-introduction-1'>Brief Introduction:</h3>
            <p>Cas nucleases with trans-cleavage activity have been widely used in nucleic acid detection. However, Cas protein&#39;s large size and low specificity for single-base mismatch recognition hinder its application in this field. 
            CRISPR-CasΦ (CRISPR-Cas12j) <a href='http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K4308005'>BBa_K4308005</a>, a RNA-directed enzyme found in phages, is about half the size of Cas12a <a href='http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K4308031'>BBa_K4308031</a>, but retains the ability to unpack and cleft dsDNA, making it valuable in gene editing. Compared with widely used Cas12a and Cas14a <a href='http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K4308006'>BBa_K4308006</a>, CasΦ has better targeting specificity, but its cleavage activity is poor. Therefore, based on a rational design strategy and the introduction of hairpin structured crRNA, we hope to construct a new CRISPR-Cas system with high cleavage activity and good target recognition specificity.</p>
            <h3 id='design-1'>Design:</h3>
            <p>In the initial design, as reported in the literature[1], CasΦ has small size, strong specificity and low dependence on PAM sequence, so we hoped to use CasΦ to connect RT-RPA and DNA nanosponge system to enhance the specificity of our entire system. However, the cutting rate of CasΦ is lower than that of Cas12a and Cas14a. Therefore, we hope to improve CasΦ&#39;s cutting rate and specificity, and establish a better CRISPR-Cas system for detection.
            We then conducted directed revolution for CasΦ protein, and screened for protein mutants with faster cutting rate and sgRNA with lower off-target rate through rational design. By altering the critical amino acids on the CasΦ protein&#39;s helix 7 and introducing the hairpin-structured crRNA, we made a point mutation. The positive controls Mut-1(nCasΦ) <a href='http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K4308015'>BBa_K4308015</a> and Mut-2(vCasΦ) <a href='http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K4308016'>BBa_K4308016</a> were created by Doudna&#39;s team. Our team created the mutants Mut-3 through Mut-6. The detailed mutation content is shown in <b>Table 1</b>.As reported by Gersbach et al, a hairpin secondary structure onto the spacer region of crRNA can increase the CRISPR-Cas system specificity for target cleavage[2]. To verify whether this strategy is effective for the trans-cleavage activity of CasΦ, we introduced different lengths of hairpin structures into the crRNA of CasΦ(<b>Table 1</b> and <b>Table 2</b>).</p>

            <p>In Mut 3-6, only Mut-4(Neg-K) had cleavage activity. When compared with Mut-1(nCasΦ) and Mut-2(vCasΦ), Mut-1(nCasΦ) had the better cleavage activity. The target-triggered trans-cleavage activity of wild-type and mutant Cas was assessed using the fluorophore quencher (FQ) reporter assays. <b>Figure 2</b> displays the outcomes of the fluorescence analysis. Compared to the wild-type, Mut-4(Neg-K) <a href='http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K4308017'>BBa_K4308017</a> exhibits a high target induced trans-cleavage activity.

            <p> The DNA detection performances of mutants were investigated by a series of DNA targets with different concentrations. The initial reaction rate of the fluorescence signal was employed to evaluate the trans-cleavage activity of different mutants. </p>
            <h5 id='result-3'>Result:</h5>
            <p>As shown in <b>Figure 3</b>, at all target concentrations, the trans-cleavage activities of Mut-1(nCasΦ) and Mut-4(Neg-K) were both significantly higher than that of the wild-type CasΦ. But there was no significant difference between Mut-1(nCasΦ) and Mut-4(Neg-K). At high (50 nM) or low (1.25 nM) concentration, the initial reaction rate of Mut-4(Neg-K) was higher than that of Mut-1(nCasΦ); at the medium concentrations (2-25 nM), the reaction rates of Mut-1(nCasΦ) were higher than that of Mut-4(Neg-K). Although this conclusion still needs more experimental data to be proved, the preliminary results show that the Mut-4(Neg-K) constructed by our team has a good trans-cleavage activity for DNA detection.

            <p>The ability of detection method to distinguish the single-base difference in the target sequence is very important in nucleic acid detection. Especially in DNA mutation analysis, it is necessary to detect the target sequence with a single-base mutation from the background of a large number of wild-type sequences. In order to test the recognition ability of wild-type CasΦ and mutants to single-base difference targets, we introduced a single-base mismatch at different positions in the target sequences (<b>Table 3</b>). </p>

            <h5 id='result-4'>Result:</h5>
            <p>As shown in <b>Figure 4</b>, when the single-base mismatch was at position 11 or 12 (number from 3 &#39;end), the nonspecific signals produced by wild-type CasΦ or mutants can be almost ignored, indicating that CasΦ has high recognition specificity for single-base mismatch at these positions. This may be due to the reduced stability of the crRNA/DNA hybrid when the single-base mismatch is located in the middle region of the crRNA and DNA target hybridization. However, when the single-base mismatch was at position 13 (number from 3 &#39;end), all of these three CasΦ nucleases produce non-specific signals that were comparable with the complementary target. Because the target recognition region of CRISPR-Cas system was limited by PAM sequence, the tolerance of mismatch would hinder the application of CRISPR-Cas system in DNA mutation analysis.

            <p>After the modification of CasΦ system, we further compared the activity of Cas12a, Cas14a, and Neg-K/H4 systems. </p>
            <h5 id='result-7'>Result:</h5>
            <p>Unfortunately, despite the significant improvement in cleavage rate and specificity of the Neg-K/H4 system compared to the WT/CrRNA system, the activity of the Neg-K /H4 system is still poor compared to the more mature Cas12a and Cas14a systems. This may be due to the small size of CasΦ, which is only half of Cas12a, and therefore its enzymatic activity is also relatively low. Although Cas14a is also small in size, it’s still a dimer which remains highly active when it is cleaved (<b>Figure 7</b>). Therefore, in order to use the best Cas system in our system, we narrowed down the candidates to Cas12a and Cas14a.

            <p>We further validated the ability of Cas12a and Cas14a to cleave DNA nanosponge in our system. We found that the ability of Cas12a and Cas14a to cleavage DNA nanosponge and release γ-amylase was similar, which was inconsistent with the relative activity of the two in the previous FQ reporter gene experiment. This is because the Cas system can only effectively release the enzyme in the shallow layer of DNA nanosponge, while it is difficult to release the enzyme in the deep layer. Therefore, the difference between the two is reduced in the cleavage of nucleic acid nanostructures. Since it has been reported in the literature that Cas14a has stronger specificity for the target sequence and can identify single base mismatches in the target keenly[3], which is more in line with the requirements of our system for specific target recognition. Therefore, we decided to choose Cas14a in the final project design.</p>
            
            <h3 id='brief-introduction-1'>Learn:</h3>
            <p>In synthetic biology, the choosing of optimal systems needs to take many factors into account.</p>
            <p>By deliberately introducing point mutations in Cas, our team created the Mut-4(Neg-K) mutant, which shares the same enzymatic activity as the mutant protein created by Doudna's team. Meanwhile, we used the hairpin-structured crRNA and achieved the optimal Cas-crRNA combination by tailoring the length of the hairpin structure to enhance the detection efficiency of the CRISPR-Cas system for single-base mismatch targets in nucleic acid detection applications. Our assay system outperformed traditional systems in terms of single-base mismatch target identification, which offers a better method for using the CRISPR-Cas system to detect nucleic acids. </p>
            <p>Though such strategies seems effective, the actual feasibility is a matter of principle. Our purpose is to improve the detection system, and thus we should pursue better specifity and faster cutting rate at the same time. Since our modification for CasΦ cannot make it more active than Cas12a or Cas14a, we finally apply Cas14a with better specifity in our system.</p>
            <h2 id='title3'>DNA nanosponge</h2>
            <h3 id='brief-introduction-2'>Brief Introduction:</h3>
            <p>In our project, a structure capable of physically separating straight-chain starch from γ-amylase was needed. We took the design of DNA hydrogel and modified it into the DNA nanostructure, figuratively called a DNA nanosponge, which can achieve the release of the encapsulated γ-amylase through Cas14a cleavage.</p>
            <h3 id='design-2'>Design：</h3>
            <p>In the original design, we wanted to cleave the hydrogel by the activated Cas14a, then release the γ-amylase encapsulated in the hydrogel which we want to build. The released γ-amylase could hydrolyze amylose to glucose, which reflects the content of biomarker(LINC00857) based on our modified blood glucose meter.</p>
            <p>To begin with, we wanted to integrate ssDNA and polyacrylamide into the system. We found the design was not reasonable because the molecular weight of the glycosylase embedded in the hydrogel is too large, and this hydrogel is too dense, the cross-linking network is complex, and the degradation time by enzyme digestion is too long, which affects the detection time of our detection system. At the same time, the lyophilized powder of this hydrogel is difficult to prepare, which will affect the overall cost of the system in practical application, which is contrary to our desired product positioning.</p>
            <p>Then, we used DNA nanosponge to completely replace hydrogels and cross-linked DNA nanostructures to encapsulate γ-amylase. We designed ssDNA1 and ssDNA2, in which ssDNA1 is modified with biotin at the end. We wanted to use SA to further bind the biotin at one end of ssDNA1 to form the cross-linked nanostructure(<b>Figure 8</b>)

            <p>According to our experimental validation, activated CasΦ can cleavage DNA nanosponge faster and more efficiently, compared to several other types of Cas proteins. Therefore, to improve the overall sensitivity of the system and further reduce the detection line, we chose CasΦ to cleavage our DNA nanosponge. Meanwhile, pure DNA nanosponge can be more easily prepared as lyophilized powders. Then, we conducted pre-experiments based on the study of KeminWang [4].</p>

We started with different assembly temperature and concentration gradients in the pre-experiment. However, the obtained results are not ideal.

            <p>Based on the rolling circle amplification (RCA) , we designed a new DNA nanosponge and a novel MBD-SA fusion protein. RCA amplified repetitive sequences have the part that MBD can recognize and bind, and the single MBD-SA fusion protein has four MBD domains, which meets the construction conditions of the DNA nanosponge. In addition, the ssDNA amplified by RCA provides more cleavage sites for Cas14a, and the new DNA nanosponge has a more integrated preparation method.</p>
            <p>Since our redesigned DNA nanosponge consists of two basic parts, long strand DNA of RCA and MBD-SA fusion protein, we choose to verify these two parts separately in engineering practice.</p>
            <p>Firstly, we designed MBD-SA fusion protein <a href='http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K4308004'>BBa_K4308004</a> based on MBD (methyl-Cpg-binding domain) and SA (Streptavidin), which can bind multiple CG-rich dsDNA. We purified the MBD-SA fusion protein in the lysate of BL21(DE3) E. coli using metal affinity chromatography. We performed SDS-PAGE experiments on the obtained supernate to initially verify that we successfully expressed MBD-SA by BL21(DE3) E. coli. As shown in <b>Figure 14</b>, we successfully purified the MBD-SA fusion protein.

            <p>Subsequently, we carried out a large number of experiments on the RCA amplification system we designed. Since the MBD-SA protein we prepared previously can only bind dsDNA, and the DNA produced by RCA amplification is ssDNA, we added complementary sequences containing continuous CG fragments to the circular DNA template when designing the RCA reaction. The ssDNA prepared by RCA amplification can form a DNA stem-loop structure in solution, so that the necessary CG-rich dsDNA fragment for MBD-SA binding was available. This is a key step in the design of novel DNA nanosponge.</p>
            <p>We performed agarose gel electrophoresis experiments after processing the amplification products of RCA. As shown in the <b>Figure 21</b>, RCA amplification has a better yield.

            <p>In order to improve the solution environment of DNA assembly, we tried to add a variety of cations to the solution to shield excessive negative charges and stabilize the assembly of dsDNA. We selected Mg2+/Na+/Ca2+/NH4+ /K+ ion configuration of 10mM solution. The volume ratio of the solution was 1:10 added to the original reaction system.</p>
            <h5 id='result-9'>Result：</h5>
            <p>We performed agarose gel electrophoresis on the two groups of DNA assembled after the improved conditions, as shown in the <b>Figure 25</b>, it is obvious that the addition of Mg2+/Na+/Ca2+/NH4+ /K+ at the same time can better help the DNA assembly.

            <p>At the same time, we further improved the dsDNA assembly temperature according to Tm (77.35℃), and designed the changing temperature gradient according to the melting curve of dsDNA(<b>Table 5</b>). To a large extent, the occurrence of misassembly was prevented (<b>Figure 26)</b>. We also further extended the self-assembly time of the DNA nanosponge system with ssDNA1-biotin:SA= 5:2,37℃, and improved the yield and crosslinking degree of the hydrogel(<b>Figure 27</b>). When the reaction time was extended to 24h, the assembly of A was improved and met our requirements.</p>

            <h3 id='summary'>Summary：</h3>
            <p>After completing all the experimental work, we discussed and compared the above schemes. DNA nanosponge based on SA and biotin requires chemically synthesized DNA and modification of biotin on one of the ssDNA, so the cost of preparing DNA nanosponge is high. 
            At the same time, the preparation of SA-biotin-based DNA nanosponge requires the reaction of ssDNA1 and ssDNA2 to form double strands at precisely controlled high temperature. Compared with RCA and MBD-SA-based DNA nanosponge, not only its overall reaction rate is lower, but also the reaction conditions and industrial preparation cost are higher.</p>
            <p>Although the affinity of MBD to DNA applied by the DNA nanosponge based on RCA and MBD-SA is less than that of biotin to SA. However, for the construction of DNA nanosponge, the affinity of MBD to DNA is fully competent.</p>
            <span><b>Table 6.</b> Advantages and disadvantages of the three scheme designs ("✔" indicates advantages)</span>

            Considering the cost, efficiency, yield, stability and other factors, we finally selected the RCA and MBD-SA-based DNA nanosponge as the component of the detection system designed by our team.</center>
