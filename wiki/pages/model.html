            <p>Our model is divided into two parts: raw letter analysis and kinetic modelling.</p>
            <h2 id='title1'>In the bioinformatics analysis</h2>
            <p>We firstly applied bioinformatics methods to evaluate LINC00875 as a potential biomarker for diagnosis and detection of prognosis within a variety of cancers. We analysed its expression levels in various cancers through TCGA RNA-seq and exoRBase2.0. We also analyzed the relationship between LINC00857 expression and tumor pathological staging using the GEPIA2 tool, which suggests that stage-specific expression changes in LINC00857 expression in case of many tumor types. The results revealed its potential biomarker function for detection. Through TCGA RNA-seq data, we found that the expression of LINC00857 had a high accuracy in diagnosing cancers. Then, we further linked LINC00857 expression with clinical data to construct models for  detection of prognosis within a variety of cancers. The results showed that LINC00857 expression was closely related to patient survival. Furthermore, we used bioinformatics methods to building a Machine Learning Model in selecting potential diagnostic lncRNA markers for atherosclerosis patients. The results showed that the lncRNAs we selected had a high accuracy in diagnosing atherosclerosis.</p>
            <h2 id='title2'>In the dynamical models</h2>
            <p>Our Dynamics Modeling section ran throughout the project. Corresponding to the four parts of the project design, we built four sub-models: reverse transcription isothermal amplification model, enzyme kinetic model for trans cleavage of CRISPR-Cas system, Model of starch hydrolysis by γ-Amylase and Electrical signal conversion model for glucose concentration.  Each sub-model was connected using upstream sub-model outputs as the downstream sub-model inputs. Finally, we simulated the kinetics behavior of the entire detection system, based on ODE equations and experimental data. Simulation output and wet lab experiment data reached a R-squared greater than 0.98. Mathematical models were solved using R as a software tool.</p>
